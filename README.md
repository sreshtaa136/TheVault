# TheVault

The Vault is a console based application which encrypts and stores passwords of users in an encrypted file. Vault allows you to make a new password entry, edit an existing entry, delete an entry, and to view your passwords.

This is of course, not the safest way to store passwords of important and heavy sources, but instead, you can store passwords or hints to passwords of sources which do not need much security.

With Vault, your passwords are safe and locked away, unless the person sneaking through this code knows python :p

## How to run the app:

1) Open your terminal/command prompt and cd into the project folder 'Vault'
2) Run the file 'TheVault.py'. This is the main file
3) You are a new user, so set up your account as a new user. You are now ready to use the application!

You can login as an existing user from the next time you run the app. 

**This app only supports a single user. DO NOT create a new account when you already have one and save your passwords. If you do so, all your data will be wiped away and old account will be deleted.**
